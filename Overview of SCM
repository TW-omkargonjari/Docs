#OEP: Overview of SCM

ARCON | SCM (Security & Compliance Management) is a tool that automates an enterprise's configuration Compliance Audit process. This provides constant visibility to the data center's compliance posture. It helps the enterprise regularly assess target devices to identify non-compliance against the implemented hardening/golden policy during business as usual.
It provides the security professionals with the ability to proactively detect, access, and mitigate the risk associated with the compliance gaps across the organization that has multi-layered IT assets. This solution helps to develop a comprehensive risk management framework with robust auditing and reporting engines. Information Security Audit is a way for organizations to evaluate their security systems and identify flaws in them.
System hardening, or OS hardening, is the process of securing a system by reducing its surface vulnerability. It minimizes a computer Operating System's exposure to threats and mitigates possible risks.
The SCM is a vulnerability assessment solution that helps the risk assessment, compliance, and audit teams identify security blind spots that remain undetected due to the lack of essential safeguards and time-consuming manual IT audits.
