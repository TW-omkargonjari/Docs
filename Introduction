# Introduction to SCM

**Security and Compliance Management (SCM)** is a critical discipline that protects assets, data, and operations while adhering to regulatory standards and internal policies. SCM involves a systematic approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating security breaches and non-compliance risks. By implementing robust security measures and maintaining compliance with industry regulations, SCM helps organizations safeguard their integrity, maintain customer trust, and avoid legal penalties. This process is essential in today's environment, where cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated and regulatory landscapes constantly evolve.
